Lite Python RPC server:
- Only pass a python class and rpc server will bind its functions
- Use the rpc virutal folder to access these calls.
For example, having the python class:

class Test:
   def f(a,b):
      return a + b

This function will be able to be accessed via http://localhost:8080/rpc/f?a=1&b=2 with a response in JSON

important: requires python2.7 or greater
